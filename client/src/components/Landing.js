              Maybe you need to set some boundaries with someone and send all
              their emails to the Bin in Gmail. You've setup that filter, but
              the problem is that Gmail automatically clears your Bin folder
              only every 30 days. So if you're tempted to check the Bin folder
              during those 30 days, you essentially could be causing yourself
              harm. What if you had a digital assistant that automatically
              cleared that Bin folder every hour? Well now it's here.
