              Currently, Gmail offers a way to filter certain emails to the
              Trash or Spam. This isn't good enough if you are tempted to check
              those folders, as emails stay in those folders for 30 days before
              getting automatically deleted. This service will automatically and
              permanently delete emails from certain email addresses every 5
              minutes.

              This will make sure that any messages they send you will be

              read them. Temptation removed :)
