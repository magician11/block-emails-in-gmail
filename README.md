# Block Emails in Gmail

Automatically and permanently delete emails from specific email addresses in Gmail.

This project is being created for those of us that want to permanently block certain individuals. Currently in Gmail the only way to block certain email addresses is to setup a filter that moves those messages to the trash. The messages will sit in trash for 30 days before being automatically deleted.

So for people that have, say, a difficult ex-partner they've blocked in this way, the user can still in their weaker moments go and check the trash for up to a month. This project will make sure that incoming unwanted messages from certain people will be instantly and permanently deleted.

Thus giving the user more internal freedom and peace of mind.
